The branch [sport-changes](https://github.com/swissalpine/AndroidAPS-1/tree/sport-changes) 
realise some changes which are very important for me:
* Ketoacidosis-Protection
  The ketoacidosis protection can be enabled in the OpenApsSMB settings. Two different strategies 
  are available for this:<br />
  (a) a reduced basal rate is delivered when the IOB is as small as if no insulin had been delivered for an hour _OR_
  (b) a minimum basal rate of f. e. 20% is always delivered and 0% TBR will be avoided.
* Set TempTargets up to 220 mg/dl / 12,2 mmol/l
* No smb if bg < 100 mg/dl
* Carbs Dialog with with an additional possibility to handle hypo situations (it sets a 
  TT and suspends the loop for 60 min with a TBR of 50%)
* Exercise mode enabled (-> setting: high tt raises sensitivity), can be toggled via overview icon for openAPSSMB, dynISF and autoISF
* No use of autosens limitations to the exercise mode result
* Integrate ISF in exercise mode
* Disable autosens for openAPSSMB and autoISF, as this feature can cause problems when interacting with exercise mode
* Toggle autosens via overview icon (dynISF only)
* dynISF with adjusted, extrapolated TDD based on the weighted last 24 hours and some safety restrictions
* LGS threshold (65-120 mg/dl; Preferences > Treatments safety)
* Layout corrections for small devices like Jelly
* Integration of autoISF (Quick guide: https://github.com/ga-zelle/autoISF/tree/A3.1.0.2_ai2.2.7)
- modified for the use of exercise mode
- another modification is that every odd target (normal target AND tt) disables smb
